    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Daniel Mojekwu, and I'm a passionate software developer dedicated to building clean, scalable, and user-focused digital experiences. With a strong background in both frontend and backend development, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic — turning ideas into functional, beautiful, and high-performing web applications.

I specialize in crafting solutions that are not only technically sound but also visually compelling. Whether I’m designing intuitive user interfaces, engineering APIs, or optimizing backend performance, I approach every project with curiosity and precision.

I love learning and experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and design trends. I believe software development is a continuous journey, and I’m always evolving to stay ahead of the curve.

      Outside of coding, I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects. I also started a business called Deemvmedia where we embrace creativity and branding. From creative designs and animation to cutting-edge software, I strive to empower ideas and bring them to life.
